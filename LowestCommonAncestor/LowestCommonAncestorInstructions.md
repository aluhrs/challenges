Given values of two nodes in a Binary Search Tree, write a  program to find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA). You may assume that both the values exist in the tree.

The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as the lowest node in T that has both n1 and n2 as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

From the BST above, the LCA(4, 8) ancestors: would be 8 since we allow 8 to be descendant of itself.
